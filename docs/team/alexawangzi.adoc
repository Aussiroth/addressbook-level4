== PROJECT: STUtor - v1.5

---

== Overview

STUtor -v1.5 is a desktop address book targeting tutor coordinators
to help them _matching_ and _managing_ a large database of tutors and students. +
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 25 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*:
added *the ability to match/unmatch a student and a tutor*
** What it does:
allows the user to choose a student and a tutor to match, or to choose a currently matched pair and unmatch it.
** Justification:
This feature makes the accounting process of matching easier.
Matching/Unmatching is done automatically after the target student and tutor is provided by the user,
therefore saving time in marking individual tutor or student and updating their status.
** Highlights:
The new Pair class interact heavily with the existing Person and Tag class,
and careful thinking is required to ensure full exploitation of the existing classes
without increasing the coupling.


* *Minor enhancement*:
Added the ability to accept case-insensitive input, as well as shortcuts,
for filling in subject, level, status and role.
On top of that, standardize storage format and display to follow <<proper-case, proper case>>.
